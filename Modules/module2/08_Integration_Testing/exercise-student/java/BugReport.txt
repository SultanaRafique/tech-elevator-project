Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee

Expected output:
2

Actual output:
1

How did you fix this bug?

Replaced if condition block with while loop, so that if results (rowSet) contains more than one row,
it should be added to returning list, and it should not always return single row.


Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByProjectId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project

Expected output:
3

Actual output:
2

How did you fix this bug?

Replaced the WHERE clause condition in sql, from employee_id to project_id, so that it can return
timesheets for project but not for employee.


Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
updated_timesheet_has_expected_values_when_retrieved

Expected output:false

Actual output:true

How did you fix this bug?
attribute (billable ) was missing from the sql , updating the timesheet, so this method was
not updating to billable attribute, just added billable attribute to the update sql.


Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getBillableHours_returns_correct_total

Expected output:0.0

Actual output:2.0

How did you fix this bug?
sql  for billableHours missing billable = true in WHERE clause, so
sql is returning hours_worked instead of billable_hours, just added "AND billable = true"
in the sql.
