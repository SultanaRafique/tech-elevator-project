            <h2>Great Quotes From Nils</h2>

            <blockquote id="quoteone" class="redborder fontnormal">
                "Whatever you do as an artist, people have to have an experience. It's not about the details or the wrong note or what tuning the piano is. It doesn't matter. It all doesn't matter. It only matters what people think when they leave the room and what their impression was."
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote id="quotetwo">
                "Why does the world need a Piano Day? For many reasons. But mostly, because it doesn't hurt to celebrate the piano and everything around it: performers, composers, piano builders, tuners, movers and most important, the listener."
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote id="quotethree">
                "The music works by itself, but you can change the perception of it by the way you dress, the way you move, the things you say, the things you don't say. And when you realize that everything is staged, then nothing is staged. There's a kind of liberation to that."
