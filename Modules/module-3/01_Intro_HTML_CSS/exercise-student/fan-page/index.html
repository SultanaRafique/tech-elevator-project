            <h2>Best Quotes</h2>

            <blockquote>
            "I have always believed that process is more important than results."
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
            "It's true that if it's always going to be that if you win the World Cup or European Championship, you're a success, and if you don't, you're a failure, then you're bedding yourself for a lack of success because there aren't many coaches who have won those things, and there are thousands who haven't."
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
            "Every player dreams of winning the World Cup, and there are very few who are fortunate enough to actually do it."
            </blockquote>
